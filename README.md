## Using Local History

This section describes how to use **Local History** -- your personal version control system. 
Via **Local History**, you can:
*	Put labels to mark and save stable versions;
*	Discard changes and roll back to the previous version;
*	View the most recent changes;
*	View changes made to:
       * A certain element or code fragment;  
       * A file or a folder.  

## Marking Versions With Labels

Before implementing any changes to a source code, you can mark a stable version with a label. You can easily roll back to this labelled version, if required.

**Note Labels** are applied to the whole project.

### Labeling a local version
To put a label on a local version:
1.	Select a file or a folder in the Project window, or open a file in the editor.
2.	Do one of the following:
       *	From the main **VCS** menu, select **Local History** > **Put Label**.
       *	By right-clicking select **Local History** > **Put Label** in the context menu.
       *	Press **Alt+Back Quote** and select **Put Label** from the **VCS Operations** quick list.
3.	The **Put Label** dialogue is displayed, fill out the label name in the corresponding field.

## Viewing Recent Changes

IntelliJ IDEA allows you to view recent changes made to a project. You can:
*	browse through the history of changes; 
*	navigate to a particular change, 
*	compare versions, 
*	discard changes, if required. 

To viewing recent changes:
1.	From the main menu, select **View** > **Recent Changes**, or use **Shift+Alt+C** shortcut.
2.	The **Recent Changes** pop-up is displayed, select the change you want to view:

       * Click the **Revert selection** icon  to discard the change.
       * Click **Expand All** or **Collapse All** options to view or hide the details.
